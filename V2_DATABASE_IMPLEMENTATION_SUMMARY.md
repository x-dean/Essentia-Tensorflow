## API Endpoints Implemented

### Authentication (`/api/auth`)
- `POST /register` - User registration
- `POST /login` - User login
- `POST /logout` - User logout
- `GET /profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /change-password` - Change password
- `GET /validate-token` - Validate JWT token

### Playlists (`/api/playlists`)

```

## Default Credentials

After running the migration, a default admin user is created:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Email**: `admin@playlist.local`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Change the default admin password immediately after first login!

## Conclusion

The v2 database architecture provides a solid foundation for a complete playlist management system with:

1. **Complete user management** with secure authentication
2. **Full playlist functionality** with collaborative features
3. **Enhanced control fields** for personalized experience
4. **Smart features foundation** for future enhancements
5. **Performance optimization** for large-scale usage
6. **Security best practices** for production deployment

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing analysis capabilities while providing the infrastructure needed for advanced playlist features and web UI integration.
