# CLI Consolidation Summary

## Problem Solved

You were missing database and other CLI options because the functionality was scattered across **6 different CLI files**:

1. `scripts/cli.py` - Simple operations
2. `scripts/playlist_cli.py` - Discovery and playlist operations  
3. `scripts/database_cli.py` - Database management
4. `scripts/batch_analyzer_cli.py` - Batch analysis operations
5. `scripts/reset_database.py` - Database reset operations
6. `scripts/unified_cli.py` - API-based operations

## Solution: Master CLI Tool

Created `scripts/master_cli.py` that consolidates **ALL** functionality from all 6 CLI files into a single comprehensive tool.

## How to Access All CLI Features

### Single Command Interface

```bash
# All functionality now available through one tool
python scripts/master_cli.py --help
```

### Database Operations (Previously Missing)

```bash
# Get database status
python scripts/master_cli.py database status

# Reset database
python scripts/master_cli.py database reset --confirm
```

### Complete Feature Set

The master CLI tool now provides access to:

#### ✅ System Monitoring
- Health checks
- System status
- Service monitoring

#### ✅ Discovery Operations  
- File scanning
- File listing
- Discovery statistics

#### ✅ Analysis Operations
- Batch analysis
- Analysis statistics
- File categorization

#### ✅ FAISS Operations
- Index building
- Similarity search
- Playlist generation

#### ✅ Configuration Management
- List configurations
- Show specific configs
- Validate configurations
- Reload configurations

#### ✅ Metadata Operations
- Search metadata
- Metadata statistics

#### ✅ Track Operations
- List tracks
- Filter by analysis status
- Filter by metadata

#### ✅ Database Operations (NEW)
- Database status
- Database reset
- Table information

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Check everything is working
python scripts/master_cli.py health

# Scan for files
python scripts/master_cli.py discovery scan

# Start analysis
python scripts/master_cli.py analysis start

# Build similarity index
python scripts/master_cli.py faiss build

# Generate playlist
python scripts/master_cli.py faiss playlist --seed music/track.mp3
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Check database status
python scripts/master_cli.py database status

# Reset database (if needed)
python scripts/master_cli.py database reset --confirm
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check all services
python scripts/master_cli.py status

# Validate configurations
python scripts/master_cli.py config validate

# Check database
python scripts/master_cli.py database status
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Entry Point**: All CLI functionality in one tool
2. **No Missing Features**: Database operations now included
3. **Consistent Interface**: Same command structure for all operations
4. **Better Help**: Comprehensive help and examples
5. **JSON Output**: Machine-readable output for scripting
6. **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and troubleshooting

## Migration

The legacy CLI files are still available for backward compatibility, but the master CLI tool provides all the same functionality plus additional features.

## Docker Usage

All commands work the same way in Docker:

```bash
docker exec -it playlist-app python scripts/master_cli.py health
docker exec -it playlist-app python scripts/master_cli.py database status
```

You now have access to **all CLI functionality** through a single, comprehensive tool!
