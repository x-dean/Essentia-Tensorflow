# Discogs API Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Authentication Header Format
**Issue**: The Discogs API was using incorrect authentication format
- **Before**: `Authorization: Discogs key={api_key}`
- **After**: `Authorization: Discogs token={api_key}`

**Fix**: Updated the authentication header in `src/playlist_app/services/discogs.py` to use the correct format as specified in the [Discogs API documentation](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:database).

### 2. Search Query Parameters
**Issue**: The search was using a `format` parameter that was filtering out valid results
- **Before**: Included `format: 'vinyl,cd,digital'` parameter
- **After**: Removed the format filter to get all available results

**Fix**: Removed the restrictive format parameter from the search query in the `search_track` method.

### 3. Search Logic Improvements
**Issue**: The search logic was not properly handling the API response structure
- **Before**: Simple return of first result
- **After**: Enhanced matching logic that checks for artist and title matches

**Fix**: Improved the search logic to:
- Try multiple search query formats
- Check for exact matches between artist/title and results
- Fall back to first result if no exact match found

## Files Modified

### `src/playlist_app/services/discogs.py`
- Fixed authentication header format
- Removed restrictive format parameter from search
- Enhanced search logic with better matching
- Improved error handling and logging

## Configuration

The Discogs API is properly configured in `config/config.json`:
```json
{
  "external_apis": {
    "discogs": {
      "enabled": true,
      "api_key": "fHtjqUtbbXdHMqMBqvblPvKpOCInINhDTUCHvgcS",
      "base_url": "https://api.discogs.com/",
      "rate_limit": 1.0,
      "timeout": 10,
      "user_agent": "PlaylistApp/1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

The Discogs API now successfully:
- ✅ Authenticates correctly with the API
- ✅ Searches for tracks and finds results
- ✅ Extracts genre information from releases
- ✅ Works as a fallback service in the genre enrichment system
- ✅ Handles rate limiting properly
- ✅ Provides detailed genre and style information

## Integration Status

The Discogs API is fully integrated into the genre enrichment system and works as the third fallback option:
1. **MusicBrainz** (primary)
2. **Last.fm** (secondary)
3. **Discogs** (tertiary)

The service properly enriches metadata with genre information when the primary services are unavailable or don't find results.

## API Documentation Reference

All fixes were implemented according to the official [Discogs API documentation](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:database), ensuring compliance with their authentication and search requirements.
